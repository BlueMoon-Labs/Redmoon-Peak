	name = "Beggar"
	tutorial = "You are without coin and without worth. The pity of others is your bread, and their mercy is your butter. Having sat by waystones and watched many a traveller pass in the hopes for alms, you've nursed a surprising talent for thievery, and have even cajoled knowledge of lockpicking out of an especially sentimental rogue."
