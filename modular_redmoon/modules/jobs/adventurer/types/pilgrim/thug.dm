	tutorial = "Maybe you've never been the smartest person in town, but you may have been the sturdiest; Good enough for soilers to pay you to cart around saigashit, good enough for miners to offload some of their work to you, good enough for a carpenter who doesn't want to pay top mams for chopped wood, and good enough for just about anyone who wants a meathead to look scary with."
