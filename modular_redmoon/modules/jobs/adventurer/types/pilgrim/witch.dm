	name = "Witch"
	tutorial = "You are a witch, seen as wisefolk to some and a demon to many. Ostracized and sequestered for wrongthinks or outright heresy, your potions are what the commonfolk turn to when all else fails, and for this they tolerate you â€” at an arm's length. Take care not to end 'pon a pyre, for the church condemns your left handed arts."
