	name = "Vaquero"
	tutorial = "Originating in the vibrant Kingdom of Etrusca, a 'vaquero' had originally been a mere cattle-driver... Now, though, it has become a title for roaming swashbucklers. Whether they set out as a defender of the commonfolk or a pilferer of purses, the Vaquero is defined by the tale they carve across continents - and more frequently - by their story's violent end."
